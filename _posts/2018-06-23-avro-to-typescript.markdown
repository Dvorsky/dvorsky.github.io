### Summary

avro-to-typescript compiles avro schema files (.avsc) to TypeScript classes and interfaces. Making using avro schematics with node.js easy and comfortable.

I did this as per requirements by my company for an easy way of generating TypeScript classes from avro schemas 
defined. Its simple to run and saves quite a bit of time porting avro schemas to objects.

Cool combination of this tool is with generic data reading from Kafka.
